# Easy Reply

Add a Reply Button to each post/comment.  

Modification of existing plugin to fix the following bugs:

- Previously it would stop working if the textarea was edited.  
- It now uses val() rather than html() to check or modify the textarea contents.  
- The animate() call has also been changed to work more reliably.
